# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: Configuration Parsing Error

### Problem
The original `netlify.toml` had parsing errors due to complex indentation and syntax issues.

### Solution Applied
Created a simplified `netlify.toml` configuration that should deploy successfully:

```toml
[build]
publish = "."

[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
```

## Current Deployment Strategy

### What Will Work Now
✅ **Frontend App** - Complete single-page application with bilingual interface
✅ **Static Risk Assessment** - Rule-based medical assessment without server dependencies
✅ **Bilingual Support** - Full English/Arabic interface with RTL support
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
✅ **Local Data Processing** - Assessment logic runs in browser

### What Won't Work (Yet)
❌ **Backend API Functions** - Serverless functions disabled due to complexity
❌ **PDF Generation** - Requires backend processing
❌ **AI-Powered Assessment** - Needs server-side processing
❌ **Session Persistence** - Data stored only in browser

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the fixed configuration:**
   ```bash
   git add netlify.toml
   git commit -m "Fix netlify.toml configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger a new deploy
   - The build should now succeed

3. **Test the app:**
   - Language selection should work
   - Patient information form should work
   - Medical questionnaire should work
   - Basic risk assessment should work

## Alternative: Full Backend Deployment

If you need the complete backend features (AI, PDF reports), consider these platforms instead:

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended for Full Features)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 2: Render
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r pyproject.toml`
   - Start Command: `python main.py`

### Option 3: Heroku
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

## Netlify Function Alternative (Advanced)

If you want to try Netlify functions again later, here's a simpler approach:

1. **Create individual function files** instead of one complex function
2. **Use Node.js functions** instead of Python (better Netlify support)
3. **Implement API proxy** to call external AI services

## Testing Your Current Deployment

After the fixed deployment succeeds, test:

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Language selection works
- [ ] Forms accept input
- [ ] Basic assessment generates results
- [ ] Arabic text displays correctly (RTL)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy with the fixed configuration**
2. **Test the basic functionality**
3. **Decide if you need full backend features**
4. **Choose alternative platform if needed**

The simplified version will give you a working pregnancy assessment tool, just without the advanced AI features. This might be sufficient for initial user testing and feedback.
