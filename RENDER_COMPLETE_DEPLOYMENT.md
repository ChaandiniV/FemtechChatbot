# Complete Render Deployment Guide for GraviLog

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment - ChatGPT-style interface"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "New" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use these exact settings:

**Build & Deploy Settings:**
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r render-requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Environment:** `Python 3`

### Step 3: That's It!
Your app will deploy automatically with:
- ✅ ChatGPT-style conversational interface
- ✅ Full AI risk assessment
- ✅ PDF report generation
- ✅ Bilingual support (English/Arabic)
- ✅ All medical features working

## 📁 Required Files (All Included)

### Core Application Files
- `main.py` - FastAPI backend with ChatGPT-style endpoints
- `templates/chat_assessment.html` - New conversational interface
- `templates/index.html` - Language selection page
- `templates/results.html` - Results display page

### Medical System Files

### Render Deployment Files

- `render.yaml` - Render service configuration (optional)
- `Procfile` - Process specification
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)
No secrets required! The app works out of the box with:
- Rule-based risk assessment (reliable medical analysis)
- Template-based question generation
- Comprehensive medical knowledge base

## 🎯 What You Get After Deployment

### Modern Chat Interface
- Looks and feels like ChatGPT
- Real-time typing indicators
- Smooth message animations
- Full mobile-responsive design (iPhone, Android optimized)
- Fixed mobile keyboard issues
- Touch-friendly interface with proper input handling

### Complete Medical Assessment

- Asks contextual medical questions
- Provides accurate risk analysis
- Generates professional PDF reports

### Bilingual Support
- Full English and Arabic support
- RTL text support for Arabic
- Medical terminology translations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
The `render-requirements.txt` file automatically avoids conflicts by:
- Using specific versions that work together
- Excluding conflicting packages like Streamlit
- Including only essential dependencies

### If App Doesn't Start
Check that your `main.py` uses:
```python
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
```
✅ This is already configured correctly!

### If Chat Interface Shows "undefined"
✅ This is already fixed in the latest version!

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

To update your deployment:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated features"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy with your changes.

## 🌐 Expected URL
After deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

The app will load the language selection page, then provide a ChatGPT-style conversation for pregnancy risk assessment.
